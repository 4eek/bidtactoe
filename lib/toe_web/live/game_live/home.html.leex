        <p>The goal of Bid Tac Toe is the same as its namesake's: get three Xs or
            Os
            in a row. But there's a twist.
        </p>
        <p>Each player starts with 81 points.
        </p>
        <p> Every turn begins with one player selecting a square that will be up for
            auction,
            and the players then submit their bid.</p>
        <p> The bid amounts get subtracted from each player's points, even if you
            lost. The winner gets to put their letter down in that square.</p>
